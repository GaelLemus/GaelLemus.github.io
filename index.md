### CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 1

  The very first lab is one of my favorite labs. This is due to how much I learned about the terminal and linux. By learning how to use the terminal, I also learned the very basics which allowed me to do the rest of the labs. 

* Lab 7 Part 2

  Lab 7 Part 2 was another valuable learning experience. I liked how simple yet sufficiently challenging the if statements needed to be in order to correctly get a sign's conditions. This lab taught me how to use if, elif, and else statements comfortably and optimally. 

* Lab 8 Part 2

  Lab 8 Part 2 was one of the harder labs in my opinion. Although some labs were more complicated in later labs, at the time those labs came around I felt prepared enough to solve them. This lab was cool because it was something very simple but to write it out in code was very challenging for me to wrap my head around. This lab taught me how to think a bit less linearly and to experiment with how I approach seemingly "simple" solutions.
